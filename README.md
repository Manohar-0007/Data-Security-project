# MNIST Image Classification with ResNet and HybridModel
Team Members: Manohar kota, Safia shaik, Bhagya teja chalicham

This repository contains implementations of two neural network models for classifying the MNIST dataset:

ResNet18 (pretrained on ImageNet, modified for MNIST)
HybridModel (a custom hybrid network combining a simple ResNet-like backbone with a fully connected classifier)
