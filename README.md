# MNIST Image Classification with ResNet and HybridModel
Team Members: Manohar kota,Safia shaik,bhagya teja chalicham

This repository contains implementations of two neural network models for classifying the MNIST dataset:

ResNet18 (pretrained on ImageNet, modified for MNIST)
HybridModel (a custom hybrid network combining a simple ResNet-like backbone with a fully connected classifier)

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:

Use a pre-trained ResNet18 model to classify MNIST digits with minimal modification.
Build a HybridModel with a custom, simplified ResNet backbone and a classifier head.
Both models aim to classify images from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
